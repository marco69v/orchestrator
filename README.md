# orchestrator
Well, this is my first project in git so not so familiar yet.

what orchestrator does:
it enqueue request for masking jobs and manages a sort of load balancing against a list of engines available
Each engines may have different number of cpu so, is up to you to fill engines or to leave at least one cpu 
free not inserting this one into the engines table.

why it was written in bash:
because where I had to implement it was a must

what you have to do in order to run:
populate the engines table with row of kind
	engine1	CPU1	
	

a lot of thing has to be finalized, described and set in a nicer look but this is why I 
decided to put in Git ;) 
if you want to help me on this youo are welcome :)

even this README has to be "betterized" :D
